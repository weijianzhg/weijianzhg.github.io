I'm a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer at Marex, focusing on building large language model (LLM) solutions in finance.

Before Marex, I led the development of a client knowledge graph for IG Group. I single-handedly created Marshmallow Insurance's in-hourse ML platform, the first of its kind in the insurance sector.
I also led the development of the ML based credit risk assessment system for Steadypay, a fintech startup in London.

I did my PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Manchester, supervised by Prof. Nick Higham, and was a visiting researcher at MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. My research area was numerical linear algebra and time-dependent networks.

## Newsletter

I've recently started a newsletter on Substack called "The Latticework of Mental Models". This newsletter explores various mental models and their applications in decision-making, problem-solving, and understanding complex systems. If you're interested in expanding your thinking toolkit and gaining new perspectives, I invite you to [subscribe here](https://latticeworkofmodels.substack.com/).
