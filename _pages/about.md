Iâ€™m a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer at Marex, specializing in developing large language model (LLM) solutions for the finance industry.

Previously, I led the development of a client knowledge graph at IG Group. At Marshmallow Insurance, I pioneered their in-house ML platform, the first of its kind in the insurance sector. I also led the creation of an ML-driven credit risk assessment system for Steadypay, a London-based fintech startup.

I hold a PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Manchester, where I was supervised by Prof. Nick Higham. I also spent time as a visiting researcher at MIT's Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, focusing on numerical linear algebra and time-dependent networks. Prior to university, I studied fine arts at the affiliated high school of the China Central Academy of Fine Arts.

## Newsletter and Other Writings

I write a Substack newsletter called "Latticework of Mental Models" about mental models for decision-making and problem-solving. [Subscribe here](https://latticeworkofmodels.substack.com/).

I also write random thoughts on [X](https://x.com/weijianzhg).
